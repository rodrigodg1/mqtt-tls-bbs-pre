# BBS-signatures with MQTT with TLS

This repository is the home to a performant multi-message digital signature algorithm implementation which supports
deriving zero knowledge proofs that enable selective disclosure from the originally signed message set.

[BBS+ Signatures](https://github.com/mattrglobal/bbs-signatures-spec) are a digital signature algorithm originally born from the work on
[Short group signatures](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~xb/crypto04a/groupsigs.pdf) by Boneh, Boyen, and Shachum which was
later improved on in [Constant-Size Dynamic k-TAA](http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~wzhang/teach-552/ReadingList/552-14.pdf)
as BBS+ and touched on again in section 4.3 in
[Anonymous Attestation Using the Strong Diffie Hellman Assumption Revisited ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306347781_Anonymous_Attestation_Using_the_Strong_Diffie_Hellman_Assumption_Revisited).

BBS+ signatures require a
[pairing-friendly curve](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-03), this library includes
support for [BLS12-381](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-03#section-2.4).

BBS+ Signatures allow for multi-message signing whilst producing a single output signature. With a BBS signature, a
[proof of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_knowledge) based proof can be produced where only some of
the originally signed messages are revealed at the discretion of the prover.
